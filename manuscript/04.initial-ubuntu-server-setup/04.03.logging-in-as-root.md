## login as root

Since a SSH key was added to the machine you are able to login as root. From a terminal on your local machine, log in as the root user. Get your server's ip address from the droplet's main page and then use the command below to log in.

```js
ssh root@your_server_ip
```

You will see the message - type 'yes' and hit enter

```console
The authenticity of host '206.189.77.123 (206.189.77.123)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:K2rtC0an9u6UPpEMwEcfUqGyjWT1ckCpCLKKjJAQ56o.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```
Type 'yes' and press enter.

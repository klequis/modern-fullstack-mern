## Setup Firewall

The utility UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is already installed on Ubuntu. For more information on UFW see the [UFW User Manual](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/en/man8/ufw.8.html)

If you check UFW's status you will see it is currently disabled.

```console
ufw status
```

Reply:

```console
Status: inactive
```

Some applications such as OpenSSH register themselves with UFW when installed. UFW can only manage applications that are registered with it.

To see which apps are currently registered:

```console
ufw app list
```

Reply:

```console
Available applications:
  OpenSSH
```

Tell UFW to allow SSH connections

```js
ufw allow OpenSSH
```

Enable the firewall

```js
ufw enable
```

Re-check status

```js
ufw status
```

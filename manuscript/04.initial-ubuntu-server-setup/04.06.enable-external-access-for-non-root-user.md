## 04.06 Enable External Access for Non-root User

> Moved this from below firewall setup to hear. Be sure that works!

Stay logged in as root until you confirm the new non-root user has access. Doing so will allow you to troubleshoot any problems with the non-root user.

Copy the root user's public SSH key to doadmin's .ssh directory. This command will create the .ssh directory along with a copy of `authorized_keys`.

TODO: it does more, including setting permissions. Explore the command and explain

```js
rsync --archive --chown=doadmin:doadmin ~/.ssh /home/doadmin

```

Login as 'doadmin'.

In new terminal window:

```js
ssh doadmin@your_server_ip
```

The command prompt should now say `doadmin@todo-server`.

You should use 'doadmin' for all remaining tasks.

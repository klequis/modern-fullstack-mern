## Create Non-root User `doadmin`

During this process you will need to provide a password for the new user. Prepare a password and put in a safe place before proceeding.

```js
adduser doadmin
```
When asked, enter the password you prepared.

Next you will be asked a number of questions. Fill-in these values as you see fit. I entered 'doadmin' for 'Full Name' and left the rest blank.

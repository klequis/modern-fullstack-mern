## Install NodeJS

Installing Node on the server is the same as you already did on your local machine. However, curl is already installed so you can skip that step.

```js
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Remove `nodesource_setup.sh`.

```
rm nodesource_setup.sh
```

Some npm packages need `build-essential` to compile code from source.

```js
sudo apt install build-essential
```

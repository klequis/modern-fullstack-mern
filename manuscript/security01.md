## 1. Injection flaws

- Use a white list
- Black lists and pattern matching do not work
- Filter both data from user and database

## 2. Broken Authentication
- No session id in URL
- Encrypt passwords in storage and transit
- Session ids must not be predictable
- What is session fixation?
- Session hijacking - use timeouts and HTTPS

**I'm using a framework - Auth0

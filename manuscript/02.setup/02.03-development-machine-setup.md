# Development Machine Setup

There are many ways to configure a development machine. Here is what you will need to complete the remainder of this book.


- NodeJS & npm
- git
- nodemon
- MongoDB
- Robo 3T
- Visual Studio Code or other editor




As mentioned, the documentation for installing Node, MongoDB, MongoDB Compass and Visual Studio Code are excellent. Follow the below links in order to install them.

We all know the pace of change is blistering fast in technology. As a result, the instructions as written in this section can become out of date at any moment. In the event that something in the sections that follow doesn't work, consult the relevant link below.

Some simple some complex like this one vs this one


## nodemon

## NodeJS & npm
The best option is the LTS version which as of the moment is v10.15.3. Installation instructions for Linux are [Installing Node.js via package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/). Windows and Mac installers are at [Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## MongoDB Local Install
The production version of our app will use [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) hosted on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas). However, for development it is easier to work with MongoDB locally. Install MongoDB on your local machine using these instructions: [Install MongoDB Community Edition](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/).

## Robo 3T
You'll want a way to view the data in MongoDB. [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/) is good tool.

Alternatively, MongoDB Compass is also good tool. Compass installation instructions are at [Download and Install Compass](https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/master/install/)

I like Compass' UI a bit better than Robo 3T. However, Robo 3T allows you to edit documents as JSON and has a full-fledged built-in query editor.

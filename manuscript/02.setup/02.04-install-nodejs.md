# Installing NodeJS

[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) is behind almost everything in MERN Stack development. Express is built on top of it, it is used for installing libraries in the development environment and much more.

The best option is the LTS version which as of the moment is v10.15.3. Installation instructions for Linux are [Installing Node.js via package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/). Windows and Mac installers are at [Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Install cURL
cURL (pronounced 'curl') is a computer software project providing a library (libcurl) and command-line tool (curl) for transferring data using various protocols. It was first released in 1997. The name stands for "Client URL". The original author and lead developer is the Swedish developer [Daniel Stenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Stenberg).

What that means is that you can use various protocals to download files, such as the current use which will download the Node setup bash script via HTTP.

If you are using a [freshly built Virtual Machine](https://klequis.io/ubuntu-vm-virtualbox/) as part of this series you will need to install cURL. You can check if cURL is install using this command.

```console
curl --version
```

If cURL is install you will see a response like this:
```console
curl 7.58.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.58.0 OpenSSL/1.1.1 zlib/1.2.11 libidn2/2.0.4 libpsl/0.19.1 (+libidn2/2.0.4) nghttp2/1.30.0 librtmp/2.3
Release-Date: 2018-01-24
Protocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher http https imap imaps ldap ldaps pop3 pop3s rtmp rtsp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp 
Features: AsynchDNS IDN IPv6 Largefile GSS-API Kerberos SPNEGO NTLM NTLM_WB SSL libz TLS-SRP HTTP2 UnixSockets HTTPS-proxy PSL 
```


Install cURL with the following command.

```console
sudo apt install curl
```

Next, use cURL to download the Node setup bash script

> 12x is not LTS so

```console
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
```

```console
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
```

The next step is to execute the script just downloaded. Note that it does not install Node and only sets up you machine so that Node can be installed.

```console
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
```

The next step is to install Node

```console
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Now check your Node version to confirm installation.

```js
nodejs -v
```

Installing Node also installed npm. Check the npm version with this command.

```console
npm -v
```

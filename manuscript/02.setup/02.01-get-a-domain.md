I'm not aware of any way to get a `.io` domain name for free. However, getting a free domain name to use with this book
is quick and easy. If you google free domain name there are many choices. The one I am using for this book is [freenom](https://www.freenom.com) and the domain name I registered is klequis-todo.tk

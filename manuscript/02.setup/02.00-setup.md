# 02.00 Setup #

Since you will be building locally and deploying to a remote server, both a client and server, as well as running a database locally, there is quite a bit of setup. Much of this book is about setup and configuration. For some, that isn't the fun part, but it is a necessary prerequisite.

Instead of writing many, many pages on how to do installation, I'll be referring you to external resources. All of the technology used in the book already has excellent installation instructions that I couldn't write any better.

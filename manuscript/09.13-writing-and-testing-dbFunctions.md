# Writing and Testing dbFunctions

We will follow a process something like this


1. Add function to `db/dbFunctions.js`
1. Export the function in `db/index.js`
1. Write a test stub to call the function
The client doesn't need everything returned by the native driver's function. We want to return only the part that will be used. First we need to see what it returns. To do this we will write a test stub that calls the wrapper function and `console.log` the return from the native function.
1. Call the function from a test to examine the return value of the native function
1. Import the function in `test/dbFunctions.test.js`
1. Examine the return value of the native MongoDB function
1. Write the test in `test/dbFunctions.test.js`


Open the file `test/dbFunctions.test.js`

__test/dbFunctions.test.js__
```js
import { expect } from 'chai'
import { fourTodos } from './fixture'
import { 
  close
} from 'db'

const collectionName = 'todos'

after(async () => {
  await close()
})

describe('dbFunctions', function() {


}
```

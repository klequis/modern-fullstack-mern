Per the Vault instructions, you can put Vault anywhere on the filesystem. We will put it in /opt/vault

> TODO: commands to do the move

Edit Env Vars & $PATH
```console
sudo -H gedit /etc/environment
```

> Not sure if the above works. The outputted instructions say to dd
```console
  $ export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
```
> I'm not sure which method worked

> Checking: There is no entry in /etc/environment so I guess I removed that or it didn't work.

> Also note that using export, the variable only lives in the active terminal session

To see a list of environment variables
```js
$ printenv
```
Or, to just see VAULT_ADDR
```console
$ printenv | grep VAULT_ADDR
```

Set export VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID

```console
export VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID="s.DBiI84tR59rL4WIcFKrLBEzG"
printenv | grep VAULT*
VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID=s.DBiI84tR59rL4WIcFKrLBEzG
VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200
```




```
vault server -dev
```

==> Vault server configuration:

             Api Address: http://127.0.0.1:8200
                     Cgo: enabled
         Cluster Address: https://127.0.0.1:8201

                 Version: Vault v1.1.1

WARNING! dev mode is enabled! In this mode, Vault runs entirely in-memory
and starts unsealed with a single unseal key. The root token is already
authenticated to the CLI, so you can immediately begin using Vault.

You may need to set the following environment variable:

    $ export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'

The unseal key and root token are displayed below in case you want to
seal/unseal the Vault or re-authenticate.

Unseal Key: 6c278r5Gm6BRqd7o/ecEj0yNcajUgn13QLWheb65k/4=
Root Token: s.DBiI84tR59rL4WIcFKrLBEzG

Development mode should NOT be used in production installations!

Write a Secret
```console
$ vault kv put secret/hello foo=world excited=yes
```

Get a Secret
```console
vault kv get secret/hello   
```

Value for a Given Field
```console
$ vault kv get -field=excited secret/hello
```

Or in JSON
```console
$ vault kv get -format=json secret/hello | jq -r .data.data.excited
```
> The above command uses something called `jq` which is not installed on my machine. However, leaving out the `jq` command:

```console
$ vault kv get -format=json secret/hello
```
Results in:
```console
{
  "request_id": "c13568a1-969f-21f1-273c-2634c0679c9b",
  "lease_id": "",
  "lease_duration": 0,
  "renewable": false,
  "data": {
    "data": {
      "excited": "yes",
      "foo": "world"
    },

      "deletion_time": "",
      "destroyed": false,
      "version": 1
    }
  },
  "warnings": null
}
```

Deleting a Secret
```js
$ vault kv delete secret/hello
```

Secrets Engines
kv is a 'secrets engine'. There are a number of secrets engines available to Vault which you can see via:
```console
$ vault secrets list
```

Enable kv on a different path
```console
vault secrets enable -path=kv kv
```

```console
$ vault write kv/my-secret value="s3c(eT"

$ vault write kv/hello target=world

$ vault write kv/airplane type=boeing class=787

$ vault list kv
```

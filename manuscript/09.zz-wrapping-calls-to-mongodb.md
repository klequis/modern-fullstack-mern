??? What is this ???
Is it still needed?

The first thing we are going to do is create wrappers to some of the MongoDB native driver's functions. Writing these functions, along with a small helper library and standardizing the way that data and errors are returned to the client will, make our code much more understandable and easier to maintain.

- About MongoDB queries
- Shaping data
- New project
- Install packages
- Create /db
- Create dbFunctions.js, helpers.js & index.js
- Import mongodb
- Store reference to MongoClient
- Connection details
- Connection management
- Returning errors
- Returning data
- Implementing `find()`
- Write tests



> TODO: what libs install, what they do and why. Maybe just links to save room and error?













## db/dbFunctions.js



All our calls to MongoDB will be done through functions in dbFunctions.js. Start by importing mongodb and getting a reference to the MongoClient.





```js




```







## server/index.js
```js
import { find } from './db'

async function findTest() {
  const todos = await find('todos')
  console.log('todos', todos)
}

findTest()
```

## Add start script in package.json
```js
"start": "babel-node server/index.js"
```

## Give it a try
```js
$ npm start
```


In the next section we will write some test for the `fined` function.

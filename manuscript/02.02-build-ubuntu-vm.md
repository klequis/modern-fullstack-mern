# Building a Ubuntu Desktop Virtual Machine with VirtualBox

## Definitions
- **Host:** - The host machine is the machine you install VirtualBox on. This will be a Linux, Mac or Windows machine running directly on the machines hardware
- **Guest:** - The guest machine is the virtual machine


## Prerequisetes
- A computer with sufficient memory (see note below). 
- 


### What is sufficient memory?
It is difficult for me to give specific guidlines as I have always used VirtualBox on a mchine with 16 GB RAM. I did try to install it on a friends machine which was Windows 8 with 4 GB, but it was unusably too slow. How much memory you need depends on your operating system. If your host is Linux you can get by with less RAM than if your host is Windows. My suggestion is to work with the memory you have. If it turns-out you have insufficient memory, no harm done.

## Download Ubuntu 19.04 Desktop LTS
- Go to: https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop
- Click 'Download'
- Wait for the download to complete or, if you have the bandwidth, move on to the next step while it downloads.

## Install VirtualBox

## Create the VM
- Machine > New
- **Name and operating system**
  - Name: something short and to the point
  - Machine Folder: the default is good
  - Type: Linux
  - Version: Ubuntu (64-bit)
  - Click Next
- **Memory Size**
  How much memory you allocate to the guest machine depends on how much memory you have on the host. With 16 GB on my host I allocate 6 GB to the guest. 4 GB is plenty for what we will be doing.
  - Enter the memory in MB (e.g., 6 * 1024 MB = 6144 or 6 GB)
  - Click Next
- **Hard disk**
  - Use the default: 'Create a virtual hard disk now'
  - Click Create
- **Hard disk file type**
  - Use the default: 'VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image'
  - Click ?
- **Storeage and physical hard disk**
  - Use the default 'Dynamically allocated'
  - Click Next
- **File location and size**
  'Dynamically allocated', chosen in the previous step, means the file size of the VM's hard drive will start a the minimum needed and grow as necessary up to the size you set in this screen. This means you could enter 100 GB here and the initial size will still be under 3 GB. 100 GB would be the maximum size it can get. I recommend putting in a large number but something significantly less then the available space on your host's hard drive.
  - Leave the location as is
  - Enter a size such as 100.00 GB
  - Click Create

You now have a VM with no operating system. You'll install one in the steps that follow.

- In the left pane, double click the the VM you just created or select it and click Start
- Click the folder icon
- Navigate to the ubuntu .iso you downloaded, select it and click Open
- Click Start

- On the Welcome screen, click Install Ubuntu

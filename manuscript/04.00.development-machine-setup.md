## Global vs Local Package Installs
Most npm packages can be installed locally or globally. I have a few global installations and since it has been some time since I installed them I don't remember the reson for doing so globally. Here is what I have as relevant global packages:

- eslint
- nodemon - global recommended
- tslint - global
- typescript - global

## eslint
## nodemon
## tslint
## typescript


The documentation for installing Node, MongoDB, MongoDB Compass and Visual Studio Code are excellent. I couldn't write it any better. Follow the below links in order to install them.

## NodeJS & npm
The best option is the LTS version whch is currently at v10.15.3. Installation instructions for Linux are [Installing Node.js via package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/). Windows and Mac installers are at [Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## MongoDB Local Install
The production version of our app will use [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) hosted on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas). However, for development it is easier to work with MongoDB locally. Install MongoDB on your local machine using these instructions: [Install MongoDB Community Edition](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/).

## MongoDB Compass
You'll want a way to view the data in MongoDB. Compass is a good tool. Compass installation instructions are at [Download and Install Compass](https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/master/install/)

Alternatively, or in addition, [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/) is another good tool. I actually use both. Compass has a nice interface for quick editing and filtering. Robo 3T allows you to edit documents as JSON and has a full-fleged built-in query editor.


## VS Code
As noted elsewhere, some of the examples refer to VS Code functionality and/or configuration. Instructions for installing VS Code are at [Setting up Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/setup/setup-overview).


> With machine configuration out of the way you are ready to start building the app!

SSH Keys & Passwords
One crucial aspect of having a server is managing SSH Keys and passwords. You need to consider carfully how to name them and where to back them up to.

One key or many?
There is a debate around this question which goes:
- Public keys are not private
- Multiple keys are hard to manage
- Your private keys are on your local machine which if it gets compromised then all you private keys are compromised. As a result, having multiple keys is not more secure
- Having multiple keys with a separate passphrase for each is a bit more secure but perhaps not enough to warrant doing so given the management it involves

Currently, I'm in the one key per server camp. I only have a few servers to manage and I'm the only person who works with them. If your circumstances are different a different strategy my serve you better.

Naming
Somewhere you need to know which key is used for what. Since I am using one key per server I name the key after the server. So 'todo-server-01' for me would be ssh-todo-server-01.

Backing-up Keys
I do two things. First, I have rsync running which makes a backup on to a separate harddrive. This of course doesn't help me if the building burns down and my hardware with it. I also keep the keys in a cloud based password manager.

Passwords
A password manager seems the best choice.

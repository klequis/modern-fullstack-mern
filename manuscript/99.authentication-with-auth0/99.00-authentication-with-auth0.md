Unfortunately, the above two documents are interlaced. That is, you need to read them both at the same time going back and forth. Here is an attempt to make it one pass


## Instructions

On the Google page

- On the OAuth consent screen, under Authorized domains, add auth0.com

    When asked to select an application type, choose Web application and set the following parameters:

| Field |	Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Name | The name of your application. |
| Authorized JavaScript origins |	https://YOUR_DOMAIN |
| Authorized redirect URIs | https://YOUR_DOMAIN/login/callback |


### Start

- Go to the [API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
- From the projects list, select a project or create a new one.
- If the APIs & services page isn't already open, open the console left side menu and select APIs & services.
- On the left, click Credentials.
- Click New Credentials, then select OAuth client ID.

> Note: If you're unsure whether OAuth 2.0 is appropriate for your project, select Help me choose and follow the instructions to pick the right credentials.
Select the appropriate application type for your project and enter any additional information required. Application types are described in more detail in the following sections.

- If this is your first time creating a client ID, you can also configure your consent screen by clicking Consent Screen. (The following procedure explains how to set up the Consent screen.) You won't be prompted to configure the consent screen after you do it the first time.

- Click Create client ID

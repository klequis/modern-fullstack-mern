## Definitions


- **Resource:** A resource can be a database, collection, set of collections or a cluster.

- **Privileges:** A privilege consists of a specified resource and the actions permitted on it.

- **Action:** An action specifies the operation allowed on the resource. For example 'find', 'create' or 'insert'.

- **Role:** A role grants privileges to perform specific actions on a resource. A role can contain one or more privilege. It can also contain other roles, in which case granting the role to a user applies the privileges in the contained role. 
  - **[Built-In Roles](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/built-in-roles/):** Built-in roles are roles that come with MongoDB by default. A complete list of built-in roles can be found at .
  - [**User-Defined roles](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/security-user-defined-roles/):** User-defined roles are roles that are created by a MongoDB user. You use them to customize privileges according to your needs.

## [Role-Based Access Control](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/authorization/#role-based-access-control)

Initially after installation, access control is not enabled. Once you enable it users must authenticate themselves.

## [Authentication Database](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/security-users/#user-authentication-database)

- So you create a given user in a given database and that becomes the authentication for the user. However, a user's privileges are not limited to that database. You can assign it roles in other databases as well.


## [Certificate Authority](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/security-x.509/#certificate-authority)

> For production use, your MongoDB deployment should use valid certificates generated and signed by a single certificate authority. You or your organization can generate and maintain an independent certificate authority, or use certificates generated by a third-party TLS/SSL vendor. Obtaining and managing certificates is beyond the scope of this documentation.



## Illustrative Info
- You can see users in roles using Robo3T. Roles are in system.roles and users in system.users

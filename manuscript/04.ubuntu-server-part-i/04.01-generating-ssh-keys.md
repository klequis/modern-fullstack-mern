## Generating SSH Keys

Use ssh-keygen to generate a new pair of SSH keys. ssh-keygen will save the keys to the current directory. Either change to ~/.ssh or enter the full path at the prompt.
`- t` is for type and  `rsa` is the type to be used
```js
$ cd ~/.ssh
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

You will be prompted for a file name. Enter a name and press enter.

> WARN: If you are not in the /.ssh folder you need to enter the full path.

```js
klequis@klequis-pc:~$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/klequis/.ssh/id_rsa): ssh-todo-server-6
```
Leave the passphrase blank and press enter
```js
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
```
Leave blank and press enter
```js
Enter same passphrase again:
```

The result will be similar to this:

```js
Your identification has been saved in ssh-todo-server-6.
Your public key has been saved in ssh-todo-server-6.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:L+fO...4 joe@joes-pc
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|                .|
|           .o.  o|
|            += = |
|          o...Oo+|
|        S   +=o!%|
|         . o +B#@|
|        . oA+.oBO|
|         - .o .o.|
|         .+  .. .|
+----[SHA256]-----+

```

Your new key is in ~/.ssh. The public key has the `.pub` extension and the private key has no extension. You will upload the public key to your new server.


Back-up your key!

TODO: if you loose the key is there another way to get to the server?

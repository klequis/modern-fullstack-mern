# Formatting Return Values

There are client errors and server errors. Here we are dealing with server errors. We will implement 3 errors

400 - request malformed
401 - unauthorized/unauthenticated - user needs to log in

404 - send the wrong uri or resource (todo) not found (e.g., when querying by _id)

It would be good to also have different rights to different resources but that is not part of the demo app yet so 403 is not implemented
403 - this condition doesn't exists as currently it is all or nothing
























#### Old Stuff

`formatReturn` will be used after each call to MongoDB to standardize the way that messages are sent back to the client.



```js
const formatReturnSuccess = (data)  => {
  return { data: data, error: null }
}

const formatReturnError = (error)  => {
  return { data: [], error: error.message }
}
```

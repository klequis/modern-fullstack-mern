Since the first database function we will create is 'find', we need something to find. Let's create a database, a collection and one document.

- Database name: todo-dev
- Collection name: todos
- Document structure
```json
_id: ObjectID
title: string
complete: boolean
```

- Make sure MongoDB is running on your local machine. If it isn't you can start it (Ubuntu command):
```js
sudo service mongod start
```

- Open MongoDB Compass
- Click on 'NEW CONNECTION'
- Fill in the fields as show below

- Click 'CONNECT'

- At the very bottom of the left-hand pannel is a small '+'. Click it to create a new database and collection.

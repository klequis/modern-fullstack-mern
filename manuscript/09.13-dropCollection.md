# Droppoing a Collection

The first database function `dropCollection` is only used by other tests. The client will never drop a collection. There is no way to test it without functions we haven't written yet, so let's assume it works. There will be some obvious errors in the other tests if it doesn't.




Before adding `dropCollection` we need to add some imports and constants, as well as an `after` hook to the top of the module.

__db/dbFunctions.js__
```js
import { expect } from 'chai'
import { fourTodos } from './fixture'
import { 
  dropCollection, 
} from 'db'

const collectionName = 'todos'

after(async () => {
  await close()
})
```


The `dropCollection` function takes one parameter, a collection name. 

Add `` to `db/dbFunctions.js`

__db/dbFunctions.js__
```js


/**
 *
 * @param {string} collection the name of a collection
 */
export const dropCollection = async (collection) => {
  try {
    const { db } = await connectDB()
    const ret = await db.collection(collection).drop()
    return formatReturnSuccess(ret)
  }
  catch (e) {
    if (e.message = 'ns not found') {
      return true
    } else {
      logError('dropCollection', e)
      return formatReturnError(e)
    }
  }
}
```

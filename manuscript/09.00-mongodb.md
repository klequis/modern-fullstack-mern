## About MongoDB queries
If you are unfamiliar with MongoDB queries, a quick overview can be found at [CRUD Operations](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.2/tutorials/crud/).

In this section we will be using `find` with a query & projection. Some good references for learning about these are:
- [Query Documents](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/query-documents/index.html)
- [CRUD Operations](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.2/tutorials/crud/)
- [Projections](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.2/tutorials/projections/)

**Chaining**

MongoDB functions are 'chainable'. For example (pseudo code):
```js
const a = find().project().toArray()
```
In this case
- the resutls of `find` are passed to `project`
- the results of `project` are passed to `toArray`
- the results of `toArray` go into the variable `a`.

## Shaping Returned Data
The client application using the API needs to know the shape of the returned data so it can process it properly. This requires the data sent to the client has a consistent shape. We will use the following shape:
```js
{
  data: [],
  error: string
}
```
- 'data' is always an array of documents even if it is only one document
- 'error' is the string returned by `e.message`

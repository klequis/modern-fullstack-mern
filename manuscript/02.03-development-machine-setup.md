# Development Machine Setup

There are many ways to configure a development machine. Here is what you will need to complete the remainder of this book.


- NodeJS & npm
- git
- nodemon
- MongoDB
- Robo 3T
- Visual Studio Code or other editor



## nodemon
As mentioned, the documentation for installing Node, MongoDB, MongoDB Compass and Visual Studio Code are excellent. Follow the below links in order to install them.

## NodeJS & npm
The best option is the LTS version which as of the moment is v10.15.3. Installation instructions for Linux are [Installing Node.js via package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/). Windows and Mac installers are at [Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## MongoDB Local Install
The production version of our app will use [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) hosted on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas). However, for development it is easier to work with MongoDB locally. Install MongoDB on your local machine using these instructions: [Install MongoDB Community Edition](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/).

## Robo 3T
You'll want a way to view the data in MongoDB. [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/) is good tool.

Alternatively, MongoDB Compass is also good tool. Compass installation instructions are at [Download and Install Compass](https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/master/install/)

I like Compass' UI a bit better than Robo 3T. However, Robo 3T allows you to edit documents as JSON and has a full-fledged built-in query editor.


## Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
While you can use the code editor of your choice, some of the examples refer to VS Code functionality and/or configuration. If you are not using VS Code, you may have to do some configuration of your editor. Instructions for installing VS Code are at [Setting up Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/setup/setup-overview).

### VS Code Extensions

- Bracket Pair Colorizer
- npm Intellisense
- Prettier - Code Formatter
- Visual Studio IntelliCode

> With machine configuration out of the way you are ready to start building the app!

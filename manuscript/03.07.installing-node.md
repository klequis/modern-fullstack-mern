# Install Node 10.x and npm

> TODO: This section needs testing. Last try I used node 8.x then installed node 10.x which required the 'extra step' below. Try the first two commands using `setup_10.x` as it currently is.
```console
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
$ ls -l
$ sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
```
Install
```js
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
$ node -v
```

Some npm packages need to be built from source. Install build-essential which will be used for such builds.
```js
$ sudo apt install build-essential
```

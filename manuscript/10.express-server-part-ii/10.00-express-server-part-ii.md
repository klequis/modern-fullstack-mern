# Express Server Part II #

In this section we begin (finish?) to build the Express Server. The best starting point is our previous project, wrapping-calls-to-mongodb. 

01. Create the project
02. Update `package.json`
03. Add packages
04. Implement Express server
05. Create routes
06. Write tests

#### Why not Mongoose?
I'm not recommending avoiding Mongoose. Its merits are obviouls from its wide-spread use. The primary reason I'm not using it is that when I was using Mongoose for a project I found reasons to go around it. That produced two ways to call the database and thereby more confusing code. I am also more comfortable working at a lower level.

### Why Ramda?
When I was first learning React I used a book that introduced Ramda to me. I'm both comfortable and happy with it, and see no motivation for using something else.

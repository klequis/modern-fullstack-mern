# Add packages

To create the Express server the following packages will be added:

- **[body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser)** is middleware that extracts the body portion of an incoming request and exposes it in `req.body`
- **[cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors)** is middleware that can be used to enable [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) with various options.
- **[express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)** is a web application framework built on top of NodeJS. 
- **[morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan)** is a HTTP request logger middleware for nodejs.
- **[fs-extra](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra)** adds promise support to Node's `fs` methods as well as additional methods that are not included in the native `fs` module.  It will be used it for the server's build script.
- **[rimraf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rimraf)** deep deletion (i.e., recursively delete non-empty folders) for Node. It will be used it for the server's build script.
- **[supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest)** provides an high-level abstraction for testing HTTP.
- **@babel/types & @types/** adds [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) definitions for their respective libraries which improves [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

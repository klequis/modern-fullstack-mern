# Create the Project

You can call your client whatever makes sense to you. Here is my suggestion:

- Create a directory named 'todo-app'
- Copy wrapping-calls-to-mongodb into the todo-app directory
- Rename wrapping-calls-to-mongodb to 'server'
- Open the server project in your editor

When we create the client it will go into a folder named 'client'

```console
| - todo-app
  | - client
  | - server
```

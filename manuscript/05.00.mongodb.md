## About MongoDB queries
If you are unfamiliar with MongoDB queries, a quick overview can be found at [CRUD Operations](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.2/tutorials/crud/).

In this section we will be using `find` with a query & projection. Some good references for learning about these are:
- [Query Documents](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/query-documents/index.html)
- [CRUD Operations](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.2/tutorials/crud/)
- [Projections](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.2/tutorials/projections/)

**Chaining**

MongoDB functions are 'chainable'. For example (pseudo code):
```js
const a = find().project().toArray()
```
In this case
- the resutls of `find` are passed to `project`
- the results of `project` are passed to `toArray`
- the results of `toArray` go into the variable `a`.


## Shaping Returned Data
The client application using the API needs to know how to process results from API calls. This requires the data sent to the client has a consistant shape. We will use the following shape:
```js
{
  data: [],
  error: string
}
```
- 'data' is always an array of documents
- 'error' is the string returned by `e.message`
